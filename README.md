# UnrealAI

Here lies a great civilization of people, who will die as they have lived.

Wide eyed by the possibilites of the world, we of UnrealAI have come together to do one thing we can't live without.
We all come together with a desire to build, to share, and to grow.

In this repository, we will be listing out some of our plans as well as our governance model.

# Plan
- Build things
  - We have AI, ML, DS stuff
  - If you have any projects within those domains, feel free to suggest them and write a planning document here!

# Governance
- Everything is Open Source
- Do whatever you want, we aren't going to nag on you
- Do something be a square and just build something
- Clouds and Dirt (Dream! and get down in the mud)
