Here lies a great civilization of people, who will die as they have lived.

Wide eyed by the possibilites of the world, we of UnrealAI have come together to do one thing we can't live without.
We all come together with a desire to build, to share, and to grow.

Here is a messafe from one of our "esteemed" founders:
```
Hey everyone! My name is Joshua Levy and I'm starting an Open Source AI project with a group of friends. There are some really interesting projects that I would like to work on as a machine learning enthusiast, and I know many people of many different talents. Believe me, this is not our day job, but I hope this serves as a medium to be expressive, intellectually stimulated, and learn some new skills along the way.

Without further-a-do, here are some initial projects that I'm interested in working on:.
```

# Plan
* Unreal Engine with Python + AI
  * Using Genetic Algorithms and Neural Networks to have a car teach itself to drive.
  * Generate new organisms and have them teach themselves how to walk through GA + NN, Spore?
  * https://github.com/20tab/UnrealEnginePython
  * https://github.com/magnificus/EvolutionTree
* Generating new Music through GA + NN (Maybe LTSM) and conversion of music to and from images (deep learning)
* Visualize a book through semantic and syntactic NLP Machine Learning and image recognition
  * Images are generated as you read the book
* Recreate mental images through ML on Neuron Networks in mind, cube model perhaps..
* Simulating longitudinal social networks
  * Social Physics - Great dataset to get started with: http://realitycommons.media.mit.edu/gallery.html
  * http://d4d.orange.com/home
* Studying how anarchic organizational patterns influence social networks, and consequently the flow of ideas that can influence productivity (maybe involvement of Social Physics)
  * Concentration on idea flow (exploration and engagement) and social learning (ideas to habits, accelerated by social pressure).
* MNIST Tests with GAs and NN; high complexity models but trying to avoid overfitting
* Game of Life: Let's take inspiration from games such as spore, and civilization, and build a game which that has agents that procreate and live life. We can include omnivores, carnivores, herbivores, birds, fish, and land creatures.
* etc.

# Governance
- Everything is Open Source
- Do whatever you want, we aren't going to nag on you
- Do something be a square and just build something
- Clouds and Dirt (Dream! and get down in the mud)

# People Who are Needed!
These are just some ideas. I'll add more, and we can also start a blog to document our progress and show off our knowledge and new skills.

We need people of all backgrounds to help with development. Particularly, we need:
* Data Scientists
* C++ programmers
* Python programmers
* Modelers/Designers/Artists
* Data Visualization Experts
* People who like to write about stuff
* Mostly, people with an interest looking for some fun and learning!!!

# Current Projects:
* CarAI- Joshua, Hide, Daniel
* MNIST_AI- Jordan, Joshua, Jeffrey
* StoryAI- Hide, Joshua

# Here's our team so far:
* Naoki - Not sure yet
* Hide - Visualization
* Joshua - Machine Learning Programmer / Data Scientist
* Jordan - Data Scientist in Training
* Jeffrey - The Idea Man / Data Scientist / ML /  Coder
* Daniel - Modeling / Artist
* Mustafa - Not sure yet
* Alex?

# Blog!
We started a blog for our development progress on Medium. Feel free to post on our page. (though here's some interesting posts about deep social networks [1](https://medium.com/@ginab/starting-a-blog-in-2017-dont-545fcefdcb2f)[2](http://try.mightynetworks.com/better_than_a_blog/?utm_source=medium&utm_medium=article2&utm_campaign=betterthanblog2017)):
